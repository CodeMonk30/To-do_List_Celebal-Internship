# TO-Do Web App for Celebal Tech Internship

Problem Statement - Develop a React To-Do List component allowing task addition, removal, and completion marking. Validate task input, display tasks dynamically, and offer optional sorting, filtering, and localStorage integration. 
This React To-Do List app helps you manage your tasks effortlessly. You can add, complete, and remove tasks, with filtering and sorting options to keep everything organized. Here's some brief testing guidance:

-Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list.
-Mark as Completed: Click on a task to mark it as completed. You'll see it get crossed out. 
-Remove Tasks: Tasks that are no longer needed can be removed with a simple click. 
-Filter Tasks: Filter your tasks to view all, only completed, or only incomplete tasks. 
-Sort Tasks: Sort your tasks alphabetically or by their completion status. 
-Persistent Storage: Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they won't disappear when you refresh the page (currently being worked upon)
